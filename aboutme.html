                    I'm Michael, a current student at C.A.R.T (Center for Advanced Research and Technology) to explore
                    possible career interests. I'm enrolled in website Application Development. But unfortunately I
                    won't be
                    attending CART next year, because of my home school schedule. I'm also a Clovis East highschooler
                    who
                    will be graduating in 2025. After high school I'm planning to go to a U.C college.

                    I would say my hobbies are anything that has to do with art or anything that has to relate to art. I
                    am interested in anything that has to do with historical contents and during my free time I usually
                    do some painting and art work.
